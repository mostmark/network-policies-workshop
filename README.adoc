= Network Policies Introduction Workshop

A hands-on workshop that teaches Kubernetes network policies on Red Hat OpenShift. Participants learn to control pod-to-pod communication using ingress and egress policies, implement cross-namespace isolation, and troubleshoot connectivity issues.

The workshop uses a scenario-based approach where participants evaluate network security for a shared OpenShift platform, progressing from default networking behavior through deny-all baselines to selective allow policies.

The content is built with Antora and published as a static site using the Red Hat Demo Platform (Showroom) UI theme.

== Local development

=== Preview with Antora viewer (recommended)

To preview the workshop content locally, run the Antora viewer container:

[source,sh]
----
podman run --rm --name antora -v $PWD:/antora -p 8080:8080 -i -t ghcr.io/juliaaano/antora-viewer
----

For SELinux environments, append `:z` to the volume mount:

[source,sh]
----
podman run --rm --name antora -v $PWD:/antora:z -p 8080:8080 -i -t ghcr.io/juliaaano/antora-viewer
----

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser. When you make changes to the content, stop the container and run it again to see updates. Live-reload is not supported.

=== Build and push a container image

The `Containerfile` builds a UBI9-based container with Apache httpd that serves the pre-built workshop site on port 8080. The container runs as a non-root user and is suitable for deployment on OpenShift.

To build the site content first, run the Antora viewer as described above, which generates output in the `www/` directory.

Then use the `build-push-container.sh` script to build a multi-architecture image (amd64 and arm64) and push it to Quay.io:

[source,sh]
----
export QUAY_USER=your-quay-username
./build-push-container.sh
----

The script builds the image as `quay.io/$QUAY_USER/network-policies-lab:latest` and pushes it to the registry. You can then run the container locally:

[source,sh]
----
podman run --rm -p 8080:8080 quay.io/$QUAY_USER/network-policies-lab:latest
----
