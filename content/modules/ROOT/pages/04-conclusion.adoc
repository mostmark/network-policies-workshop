Congratulations! You've completed the Network Policies Introduction workshop.

== What you have learned

Throughout this workshop, you've gained hands-on experience with:

* How pod networking works by default in OpenShift, with open communication between all pods
* The deny-all pattern as a security baseline following the principle of least privilege
* How to use pod selectors and namespace selectors to create targeted allow rules
* How to allow traffic from OpenShift platform services (ingress controllers, monitoring)
* How egress policies control outbound traffic and prevent data exfiltration
* How to implement cross-namespace policies using namespace labels
* A systematic troubleshooting methodology for diagnosing network policy issues
* How network policies are additive, meaning the union of all matching policies determines allowed traffic

You now have the skills to implement comprehensive network segmentation in OpenShift to improve security posture and meet compliance requirements.

== Key takeaways

The most important concepts to remember:

. **Default behavior is open**: By default, all pods can communicate with any other pod in the cluster. Network policies are required to restrict this communication.

. **Deny-all is your foundation**: Start with a deny-all policy and explicitly allow only the traffic that's needed. This follows the principle of least privilege.

. **Labels are the key**: Network policies use labels on pods and namespaces to identify traffic sources and destinations. Proper labeling strategy is essential for effective network policies.

. **Policies are additive**: When multiple network policies select the same pod, the union of all rules determines what traffic is allowed. There's no deny rule, only allow rules that build on the deny-all baseline.

. **Test before production**: Always test network policies in a non-production environment. Incorrect policies can break application communication.

== Next steps

Ready to continue your journey? Here are some recommended next steps:

=== Recommended workshops

Explore related workshops to expand your skills:

* **OpenShift Security Fundamentals** - Learn additional security controls including RBAC, SCCs, and image security
* **Service Mesh on OpenShift** - Implement zero-trust networking with mutual TLS and advanced traffic management
* **OpenShift Administration** - Master cluster administration including network configuration and troubleshooting

=== Documentation and resources

Deepen your knowledge with these resources:

* link:https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/network_security/index[OpenShift Network Security Documentation^] - Complete guide to network security features
* link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/[Kubernetes Network Policies Documentation^] - Upstream Kubernetes network policy concepts
* link:https://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developer Portal^] - Tutorials, guides, and developer resources

=== Practice Projects

Put your new skills to work:

. **Secure a microservices application**: Take an existing multi-tier application and implement network policies to isolate each tier (frontend, backend, database).

. **Document network dependencies**: Create a network policy audit for an existing namespace, documenting which pods communicate and creating policies to enforce those patterns.

. **Implement AdminNetworkPolicy**: Explore cluster-wide network policies using AdminNetworkPolicy resources for baseline security across all namespaces.
