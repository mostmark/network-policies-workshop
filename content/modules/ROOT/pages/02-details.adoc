== Environment setup

=== Pre-configured for you

Your lab environment is already set up with:

* OpenShift cluster access
* Web Terminal with `oc` CLI automatically authenticated
* Sample applications ready to deploy

=== Using the Web Terminal

All CLI commands in this workshop are run in the OpenShift Web Terminal. The Web Terminal runs directly in your browser — no local `oc` CLI installation is required.

. Open the OpenShift console by navigating to pass:[<a href="%OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL%" target="_blank">%OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL%</a>].

. When prompted, log in with your username `{OPENSHIFT_USERNAME}` and password `{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}`.

. Click the command-line terminal icon (*>_*) in the upper-right corner of the console masthead.

. Select your project from the *Project* dropdown if prompted.

. Click *Start* to launch the terminal session.

. The Web Terminal comes preinstalled with `oc`, `kubectl`, and other CLI tools, and is automatically logged in with your user credentials. No `oc login` is required.

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc version
----

Expected output: OpenShift client and server version information

== Troubleshooting guide

=== Common setup issues

**Problem**: "oc command not found"

**Solution**: Make sure you are running commands in the Web Terminal in the OpenShift console (click the *>_* icon in the upper-right masthead). The `oc` CLI is preinstalled in the Web Terminal. If you are using a local terminal, switch to the Web Terminal instead.

**Problem**: "Unable to connect to OpenShift cluster"

**Solution**: Verify network connectivity and login credentials. Try logging in again:

[source,bash]
----
oc login -u %OPENSHIFT_USERNAME% -p %OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD% %OPENSHIFT_API_URL%
----

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when creating resources

**Solution**: Verify you're logged in as the correct user and have the necessary permissions:

[source,bash]
----
oc whoami
oc auth can-i create networkpolicies
----

=== During workshop support

* Use the Web Terminal in the OpenShift console for all commands
* Check the OpenShift web console for visual feedback
* Ask your instructor if you encounter issues
