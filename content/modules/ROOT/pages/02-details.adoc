=== Verify your environment

When you start the lab, verify your setup by running these commands in the terminal:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc whoami

== Troubleshooting guide

=== Common setup issues

**Problem**: "oc command not found"

**Solution**: The `oc` CLI should be pre-installed in your terminal. If not available, contact your instructor or lab support.

**Problem**: "Unable to connect to OpenShift cluster"

**Solution**: Verify network connectivity and login credentials. Try logging in again:

[source,bash]
----
oc login -u {openshift_username} -p {openshift_password} {openshift_api_url}
----

**Problem**: "Permission denied" when creating resources

**Solution**: Verify you're logged in as the correct user and have the necessary permissions:

[source,bash]
----
oc whoami
oc auth can-i create networkpolicies
----

=== During workshop support

* Use the lab terminal for all commands
* Check the OpenShift web console for visual feedback
* Ask your instructor if you encounter issues
