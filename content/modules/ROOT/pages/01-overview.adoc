== Your role and mission

You're a developer at ACME Corporation, and you've been assigned to evaluate network security for the company's shared OpenShift platform.

ACME uses OpenShift as an application platform for various types of applications, from microservices to monolithic applications. As OpenShift is a shared environment, the security team needs clarification on what is required when applications need to communicate outside their namespace. Your manager has explained: "We need to build a clear list of network dependencies and ensure secure communication between services."

**Your assignment**: Evaluate Kubernetes network policies and determine how they can address ACME's network security requirements.

**The objective**: Demonstrate how network policies can control pod-to-pod communication and prevent unauthorized access between application tiers.

== Success criteria for your mission

By the end of this workshop, you'll have practical network policy skills to address ACME's security challenges:

* Understand default pod networking behavior in OpenShift
* Create ingress policies to control incoming traffic to pods
* Create egress policies to control outgoing traffic from pods
* Test and validate that network policies are enforced correctly
* Troubleshoot common connectivity issues caused by network policies

**Technical outcome**: You'll have hands-on experience with network policies that directly applies to ACME's current security requirements.

**Business benefit**: A proven approach to network segmentation that improves security posture and meets compliance requirements.

== Target audience

This workshop is designed for:

* Developers who need to secure their applications in shared clusters
* Platform engineers implementing network security policies
* DevOps engineers looking to understand network isolation
* Anyone interested in Kubernetes network security

== What you need to succeed

You should have:

* Basic command line experience (Linux/Unix), you've used a terminal before
* Understanding of Kubernetes concepts (pods, namespaces, and services)
* Access to a computer with internet connectivity
* Willingness to learn (no prior network policy experience required)

== ACME Corporation's security challenges

**The situation**: ACME Corporation needs to improve network security for their shared OpenShift platform where multiple teams deploy applications.

**Project timeline**: Evaluate network policies and implement a proof-of-concept within the current project cycle.

**Current challenges** (operational pain points):

* **Open communication by default**: All pods can communicate with any other pod in the cluster, creating security risks
* **Unclear network dependencies**: Teams don't have visibility into which services actually need to communicate
* **Compliance requirements**: Security audits require network segmentation between application tiers
* **Incident response**: When security incidents occur, lateral movement between pods is too easy

**The opportunity**: Kubernetes network policies can address these challenges, and you've been selected to evaluate their feasibility for ACME's use case.

**Technical perspective**: "Network policies have proven benefits at other organizations, but I need to evaluate how they would work with our specific applications and infrastructure."

== Your vision of success

If network policies prove effective for ACME's use case, here are the potential improvements:

**Immediate improvements** (short-term):

* **Controlled communication**: Pods can only communicate with explicitly allowed services
* **Clear network dependencies**: Network policies document which services need to communicate

**Strategic benefits** (longer-term):

* **Improved security posture**: Reduced attack surface and limited lateral movement
* **Compliance readiness**: Network segmentation meets regulatory requirements
* **Incident containment**: Compromised pods cannot easily access other services

**Success metric**: A demonstrable improvement in network security that can be presented to stakeholders as a viable solution for ACME's operational challenges.

== Common questions

**"Do network policies work with existing applications?"**

Yes. Network policies are applied at the network level and don't require application changes. Your existing applications continue to work, you're just controlling which traffic is allowed.

**"What happens to existing connections when I apply a policy?"**

Existing connections are typically preserved. New policies affect new connection attempts. Always test in a non-production environment first.

**"Can I start with deny-all and add exceptions?"**

Yes, and this is the recommended approach. Start by denying all traffic, then explicitly allow only what's needed. This follows the principle of least privilege.

**"What if I lock myself out?"**

Network policies are namespaced resources. If you apply a policy that blocks all traffic, you can still use `oc` or `kubectl` commands to modify or delete the policy. The API server communication is not affected by NetworkPolicy resources.
